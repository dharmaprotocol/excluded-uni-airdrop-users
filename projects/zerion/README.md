### About
The Dune Analytics link above contains a query that pulls addresses that were indirectly Uniswap traders via Matcha, but were not listed among the addresses able to claim the initial distribution of UNI (see, https://mrkl.uniswap.org/). The output of that query was used to create `accounts.txt` in this directory.
